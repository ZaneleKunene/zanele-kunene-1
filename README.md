Project creation repository for my first assignment on software engineering
This program defines a function called greet() that takes a user's name as input and prints a greeting message. It demonstrates basic Python function creation, calling, and string formatting.
def greet(name):: This line defines a function named greet. It takes one argument name.
The function body is indented and contains the code that will be executed when the function is called.
Inside the function, print(f"Hello, {name}!") uses an f-string to format the string and insert the value of name into the greeting.
greet("Zanele"): This line calls the greet() function and passes the string "Zanele" as an argument.
The function then prints "Hello, Zanele!".
The developer used google colab to run the code
